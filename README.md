ReUDD
=====

ReUDD - Regarding User Driven Development - 
is a user centric "data in/report out" web site solution
using the graph database Neo4j.

ReUDD was developed during the master thesis
work of the student Jonas Andersson, supervised by Björn Granvik.
The thesis was performed at Jayway AB in Malmö for the account of
Lund University, faculty of engineering, department of computer
science. 

ReUDD allows for use-first during software development and can
detect desire paths in the users' usage of it.
